# Pi-Big-Ben
Raspberry Pi 3 Big Ben hourly chiming analogue clock using 3.5 inch touchscreen
This application is tested for use with a Raspberry Pi Model 3 B and a 3.5 inch LCD touchscreen
It uses HTML Javascript for clock movement with the Chromium browser found in the popular Raspbian images.
The BigBen folder should be placed in the Downloads folder "/home/pi/Downloads/" :: The files contained in the Picture folder should be placed in the Picture folder "/home/pi/Pictures" : The PiClock17.html can be run from anywhere on the Pi ( best place Desktop ) by double clicking (double prodding with plastic stick)
When the HTML is opened by Chromium, fullscreen should be selected (f11 or from the menu)
Screen blanking may occur after 10mins-15mins if it is enabled in the Pi configs :: installing xsreensaver and disabling this, seems to be the best option
